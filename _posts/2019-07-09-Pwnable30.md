The problem is, it's using the function gets() which has the vulnerability on checking the size.

Let's just look at it by GDB.

The size of stack is 0x28, which is 40 in decimal. And most of the cases, the RET is after SFP which is right just after the stack.
Therefore I have to fill 44 bytes with usless values, and it looks like I have to put the address of shell code after it.

But this time, there's no part where calling the function setreuid, and I got it by googling.

Now it's time to make payload.  
As I said, I have to put uselss values for 44 bytes, and I have to put that address.

Done!
