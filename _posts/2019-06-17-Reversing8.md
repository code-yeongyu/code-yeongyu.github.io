# Byte ordering - Little Endian, Big Endian
Let me say I made a variable and put '0x123456' into that.
## Big Endian
In big endian, the data would look like exactly the same as you put.  
Therefore, I can say big endian is the way how we save information.
## Little Endian
In Little Endian, the orders of data are reversed.  
Therefore, the data '0x123456' would look like '\x56\x34\x12'.  
In the book I study with, it says that it's much efficient when the type of data expands or contracts.

# Registers
I was a bit surprised cuz I only knew the general purpose registers.


So, in the 'Basic Program Execution Register', there are four kinds of registers. and they are:
* General Purpose Registers (consisted of 8 32bit registers)
* Segment Registers (consisted of 6 16bit registers)
* Program Status and Control Register (a 32bit register)
* Instruction Pointer (a 32bit register)

## General Purpose Registers
* EAX: Accumulator for operands and results data.
	- usually, be used for the return value of a function
* EBX: Pointer to data in the ds segment
	- be used with 'ESI' and 'EDI' register for index
* ECX: Counter for string and loop operations
	- be used for loop count such as the i of 'for(int i = 0;i<3;i++);'
* EDX: I/O Pointer
	- be used for saving the value of Input / Output pointer
