I almost solved the mainsource, the hacker school ftz.  
It looks like I can learn a lot of things, as level increases, like requires me to make the shellcode.. or so.

Anyway, I started to solve these problems just to do my club homework, and I actually didn't like to solve it, cuz it's pwnable problems.  
But after solving them, I realized that they have a lot in common.

So, I thought that there's no reason to limit my major only for reverse engineering. Pwnable is also fun, and you know, most of CTFs have the pwnable problems the most, and there are not much reverse engineering problems.

So, now I'm interested in Pwnable! It would be my second major since reverse engineering is the most enjoyable thing for me.
