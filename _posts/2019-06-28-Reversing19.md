I'm just a Korean who can speak English a little bit, and I only can have basic communications with others in English.  
Since I started to learn English, I always tried to think and write straightly in English.

And recently, I noticed that this is a very bad habit. I found that I have a problem with fluency.  
Because I only can use limited words, the more letters are needed to express what I want to. And, you know, that makes readers hard to understand.

I write the report to record what I study, but also I want to help readers to study what they want to.

But like this way, writing posts like in a factory, I think it can make my posts worthless.

I'm sorry about my self.  
It'll take more time to make a post, but I'll write it in my mother language, Korean, then I'll translate it in English.

Although I don't have any computer science things, I stop here for a new start.
