Hacker School is the most famous Korean hacking tutorial for newbies who want to study Hacking.  
I solved from level1 to level 13, therefore I have to solve the level 14 to 20, which are my club homework.

By the way, from level 14, it says that it's from the mainsource. ~~I still actually don't know what it is~~  
So I'll write here the write-ups of them.

BTW, the problem is this. This is the source code of attackme.
![level14_problem](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-M_8xWfhif88/XSLMFMpHQqI/AAAAAAAAULA/DHRk14FkEHkIszoDnuA3UQyjAQIzTx7jQCLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-07-08%2Bat%2B13.25.35.png)

So when the value of the variable check equals the 0xdeadbeef, it'll give me the shell.

Since main doesn't have any arguments such as argc and argv, I have to use the Linux pipelines.

Anyway, I tried to analyze it with the gdb because I have to figure out where and how to attack, and here is it:  
![level14_assembly](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Wu0NMgQgy-E/XSM9bCn00uI/AAAAAAAAUL4/OHDBvT1UPJUHzhTNlhOBQ1zv7FLsSAZkACLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-07-08%2Bat%2B13.28.31.png)

The part that making the variable(sub esp, 0x38) means that the total size of the stack is 0x38, which is 56 in decimal.  
And you can see giving the address ebp-56 to fgets(the part giving the arguments, push ebp-56). This means that the start address of buf is ebp-56.

And you can see the cmp, which means 'if', with the ebp-16.  
This means that the address of check is ebp-16.

So the payload will be like this. (Any value)*40+"\xef\xbe\xad\xde"
(the things after *40 is the little-endian-encoded 0xdeadbeef.)

So using the Linux payload feature, this is the payload.

```bash
(python -c 'print "A"*40+"\xef\xbe\xad\xde"';cat)|./attackme
```
