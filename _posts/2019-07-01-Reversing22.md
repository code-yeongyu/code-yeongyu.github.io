I wanted to know how they encrypt the string at the name field, so I debugged the codes for a while, and I found a loop.  
Which creates the serial code.  
The first thing I found is, the program only uses the very first four values of what I typed.  
I was able to find it by looking at this code, set loop count for 4.

And here is the loop code where encrypts the very first four values.
