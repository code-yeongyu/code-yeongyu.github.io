# Let's crack
Two days ago, I introduced "crackme". And, today, I tried to crack the crack me level 1, and here is the write up how I solved it.

## Execute it
So, when I first executed the crackme level 1, you'll see such this popup.  
![crackmeFirstPopup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock.github.io/master/assets/pictures/crack1_first_popup.png)
If you press 'ok' here, you'll see this message.

Therefore, I had to make this application to think that HD as a CD-Rom.  

## Debug it
I opened it with the ollydbg, and here is the capture of it.

What I thought it's weird is that it doesn't have any stub code, which means it's coded with assembly, not by another computer languages.  
### How to give parameters to a function
Let's look at the operations before the function MessageBoxA calls.  
![MessageBoxA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock.github.io/master/assets/pictures/functionCall.png)
This part can be translated into C, like:
```c
MessageBoxA("Make me think your HD is a CD-Rom.", "abex\' 1st crackme", MB_OK|MB_APPLMODAL);
```
You'll ask like, "Hey, I can't get it. According to that assembly code, the string "Make me" thing is not the first. The first one should be the MB thing".  
The answer to this question is can be found if you think how stack saves the data. It's a LIFO struct, right?  
### Find where to patch
The operations with blue lines are garbage codes, which are added to hackers feel difficult to hack this application. So, it doesn't have any meanings.  
The operations with red lines are 'if' in C.  
CMP is a shortage of compare, so it compares to values that are given to parameter.  
#### How cmp works
I once mentioned about the ZERO flag while explaining the flag registers.  
If the result of subtraction between the parameters that are given to cmp equals 0, the zero flag turns on.  
The next operations such as 'je' 'jle' 'jne' are executed by referencing the zero flag.

## Patch
The method I tried is to replace the 'je' which means "jump equal" into 'jne' which means "jump not equal".

Done!

P.S: the way the book suggests is to replace je into jmp. but jne still worked because I changed the condition into 'if not'.
