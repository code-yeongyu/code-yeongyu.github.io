# Reversing.kr ?

Reversing.kr is the one of the most famous website for Korean reversers.  
It has a lot of reversing problems including windows, linux and macOS.

Anyway, This is my first problem in the Reversing.kr.  
First up, let's download the executive file.  
You can have all the problems [here](http://reversing.kr/).

So it's a simple program which compares the password with the string that I wrote.

![easycrack_2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock.github.io/master/assets/pictures/easycrack_2.png)

Anyway, let's open it with the ollydbg.  
It looked like this.  
![easycrack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock.github.io/master/assets/pictures/easycrack.png)  
When I first saw this, I thought it's written in VB, but now I look again, I think it's written in C/C++, since there's not much long STUB code.

Anyway, I tried to search all the strings in this program.  
![easycrack_strings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock.github.io/master/assets/pictures/easycrack_strings.png)  
And as you can see in the picture, there were some codes which seem to determines whether the password is wrong or right.  
Here is the checking part.  
![easycrack_firsttotwo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock.github.io/master/assets/pictures/easycrack_firsttotwo.png)

Well, the comments are already there because I solved it already.  
Anyway, the way I figured out the first CMP one was just guessing.  
Because the hex 61 was so friendly to me, I just filled the input field with "aaaaa", and I was able to pass the first check part.  
By trying "1234a" to "1a345", I finally figured out that it's the part whether the [argument+1] is a or not.

And now it's the second part.  
![easycrack_two](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock.github.io/master/assets/pictures/easycrack_two.png)  
There's an error in the comment. It's not [argument+3]. It's [argument+2].

Because of the register pannel which was displaying "345", I thought that this part is something like

```c
strncmp([argument+2], "5y", 2);
```

And it was true. I passed this part with the argument "1a5y56789".  
Let's look at the next part.  
![easycrack_three](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock.github.io/master/assets/pictures/easycrack_three.png)  
There is a part which looks very alike to the previous checking part.  
Like the previous part, because the register pannel was displaying "56789", I thought that this part is something like

```c
strncmp([argument+3], "R3versing", 9);
```

So with the "1a5yR3versing", I passed it.  
And now it's the last part.  
![easycrack_four](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock.github.io/master/assets/pictures/easycrack_four.png)  
It's comparing esp+4 with hex 45, which is 'E' in ascii.  
And as you can see in the stack segment, the address esp+4 is where the argument is located.

So the payload is:

```
Ea5yR3versing
```
