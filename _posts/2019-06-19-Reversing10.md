# Stack
A stack is a FILO(First In Last Out) data structure.  
And in memory, there is a section which uses the stack. It's also called 'stack section'.  

To be comfortable, I'll short the word stack section into 'stack'. So the stack I'm talking about this article is about the stack section in memory.

Stack has these roles.  
1. Saves local variables
2. Give parameters to a function when calls the function
3. Saves the return address

Because the stack is a FILO data structure, it grows from down to up, High Address(from 0xFFFFFF to 0x000000). It would be easy to understand how you stack dishes. 

Therefore, if you push an integer value into the stack, the TOS(top of the stack) which the ESP register points decrease for 4bytes cuz the TOS moved to the upside.
On the same principle, if you pop an integer value into the stack, the esp increases for 4 bytes.
