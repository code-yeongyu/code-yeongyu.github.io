It's amazingly similar to the previous problem.

This problem uses the function pointer, therefore I have to use it.  
It was a bit surprising for me since I haven't actually seen the code which uses it.  
Anyway, function pointer is also a pointer. The only difference is just it's calling the function by pointer.

I tried to analyze it with gdb to see if there's any difference not like I expected.

ebp-56, ebp-16. Yes. It's something that you've seen at the previous problems.  
Anyway, the way to attack it is very simple.  
I have to change the address which call has into the shell from the printit.

So now it's time to find the address of shell.

```
disass shell
```

Address of shell: 0x080484d0  
So this is the payload I used.

```bash
(python -c 'print "A"*40+"\xd0\x84\x04\x08"';cat)|./attackme
```

Super-duper easy.
