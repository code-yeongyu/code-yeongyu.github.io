When the function is about to end, it needs to be restored as before, and the commands of it are these.
```
mov esp ebp
pop ebp
```
to explain these commands, you have to remember how we made the stack frame at the function prologue.  
At the Prologue, we've seen such these commands.
```
push ebp
mov ebp esp
```
We stacked another area of the function, by changing the ebp. And when the function is about to end, to restore as before, change the esp as before, and ebp as before.
That's the function epilogue.  
I think I have to spend more time studying the reversing.  
I seriously feel that it's really hard to write an article for a day cuz lacking of the time.
