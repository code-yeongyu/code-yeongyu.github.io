# cdecl
Cdecl calling convention is useful for making creating variable arguments because it's hard to handle on other calling conventions.
Cdecl is a calling convention that the caller of the function cleans the stack when after the calling function is returned.

As you can see, the caller cleans the stack by the operation ADD ESP, XXX.

and the command RETN doesn't have any parameters, while the stdcall way has a parameter.  
C uses this calling convention as default, but you can use _stdcall by typing the keyword _stdcall behind the type of the function.

# stdcall
Stdcall is a calling convention that the callee cleans the stack when it's executing the RETN operation.  
Therefore, the operation ADD ESP, XXX is unneeded.

It has advantages than cdecl because you don't have to clean the stack every time after the function is called.  Therefore you can reduce the size of the code.  
Win32API uses this calling convention as default, while Win32API is written in C.  
You may wonder the reason why. It's because to increase the compatibility when a programmer uses it with other languages such as Delphi, Visual Basic, ETC.

# fastcall
It's based on stdcall, but it uses ECX and EDX registers instead of using stack section, it's only available when the parameters are less than two.  
As the name of this calling convention, it's faster than stdcall and cdecl when you call a function because the speed of the register is faster than using ram.  
But to use the ECX and EDX registers, sometimes additional overheads are needed. Like, if there are some important data on the ECX and the EDX registers, you have to back them up.  
Also, when the function is so complex that have to use the ECX and the EDX registers, additional overheads would be needed.
