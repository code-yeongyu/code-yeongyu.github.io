It's very similar to the previous problem.

However, the variable check is now pointer, which means I have to put the address where 0xdeadbeef is located.  
So I put the 0xdeadbeef into the environment variables, but it was not working for some reason.

So I just inspected the function main with the x, and the 0xdeadbeef was there.

...And solved!
