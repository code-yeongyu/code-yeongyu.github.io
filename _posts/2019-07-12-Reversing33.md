Chapter 1 of the book which I'm reading is ended.  
By answering to a person who does reverse engineering really well in my club, I got some tips from him.

But before we start, let's write down here what I've done about a month.
Crack me 1, Crack me 2, and Lena's Reverse Engineering.

By reverse-engineering them, I can learn a lot of stuff, and I'm pretty comfortable to read assembly codes now.

There's a famous website for Koreans which is called reversing.kr.  
This website has a lot of problems with various difficulties, easy to hard.

As he suggested me, now I'll solve easy crackme and easy keygen. And also I'll make the serial creating algorithms in C.
