Ollydbg has some shortcuts, and today I used F7 which does step over(and goes into the function call), and F8 which does step over(doesn't go into the function call).  
Ctrl+F9 does the command 'execute till return'.


So with these shortcuts, I tried to find where the main function is.  
Because the example code contains the function, 'message box', to find the main function, I needed to find a function which executes that.

![mainFunc](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock.github.io/master/assets/pictures/enterted%20into%20main%20function.png)

and I finally got into it.  
The reason I thought that I found the main function is because of the "www.reversecore.com", and the "MessageBoxW".
