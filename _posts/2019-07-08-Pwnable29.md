It's not similar to the previous problem.

...Damn, the code is really long.
By just looking over it, the function read is the part where gets the input.
You know, the array and the pointer is the same. Therefore I thought that I have to access to the check by using it.

The start address of check should be the [string-4] at least, so I tried to 0x80 four times and so on and the beef, but solved just in a time.
