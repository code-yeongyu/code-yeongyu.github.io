[After I solve the EasyCrack](https://kim-yeon-gyu-exlock.github.io/reversing/2019/07/17/Reversing38.html), I thought it would be nice if I make a C copy version of it.  
So I made it with the same algorithm which EasyCrack uses.

```c
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void RaiseWrong() {
	printf("Incorrect Password");
	exit(0);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	if(argc == 1){
		printf("The numbers of argument should be more than 2");
		return 0;
	}
	if(argv[1][1] != 'a')
		RaiseWrong();
	if(strncmp(&argv[1][2], "5y", 2))
		RaiseWrong();
	if(strcmp(&argv[1][4], "R3versing"))
		RaiseWrong();
	if(argv[1][0] != 'E')
		RaiseWrong();
	printf("Congratulation !!");
	return 0;
}
```

So this is what it looks like.

To explain the memory structure, I'll post about some C basics about three to four days

# What is function?

You may hear of function in your math class.  
It's also pretty similar in programming.

**"A box that returns output by an input"**

This will be the concept you learn from a math class.  
In programming, the input can be none, and the output can be none.

In math, the output weighs a lot, but function in programming, the output can be meaningless or nothing. Sometimes some functions weighs more on process than the output.

The examples of functions in C are printf, scanf, gets which are defined in header file stdio.h.

# Reason to use

Let me say a boy, exlock got an homework to memorize some words.  
Exlock wanted to make a program which can help him to memorize words.

He started to make a simple program which shows the spelling of it and gets input from the user the meaning of it.

And he wanted to make a feature that saves **what was wrong, what was right**. Also even if the user exits the program after the program is completely executed, he wanted to write codes that does the same thing.(**What was wrong, what was right**)

And exlock got curiosity.

> Do I have to write same codes for twice? Then, If I have to change the codes of it, do I have to modify them for twice?

In this case, function can be a great solution of it.

# The usage of function

## How to define it

There are two ways to make a function.  
One way is to make a prototype of a function before the main is defined, and the other way is to write the whole code before the main.

So this is the way #1:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void save();

int main(){
    return 0;
}

void save(){
    //저장시키는코드
    printf("saved\n");
}
```

And this is the way #2:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void save(){
    //저장시키는코드
    printf("saved\n");
}



int main(){
    return 0;
}
```

A function can be defined with this syntax.

<type> <name>(<parameteres>){
<content>
return <content to return>;
}

So there are four kinds of functions, and they are:

With arguments and return:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int temp(int a){
    return a+3;
}

int main(){
    return 0;
}
```

With arguments but without return:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void temp(int a){
    printf("%d", a);
}

int main(){
    return 0;
}
```

With arguments, but without return:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void temp(int a){
    printf("%d", a);
}

int main(){
    return 0;
}
```

Without arguments, but with return:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int temp(){
    return 55;
}

int main(){
    return 0;
}
```

Without arguments and return:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void temp(){
}

int main(){
    return 0;
}
```

## Usage

Then how to use it? We already know the answer, to be honest.  
<The name of function>(<parameters>);
The example would be:

```c
printf("Hello world");
```

## Global Variable, Local Variable

I'll give you a simple quiz.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void temp(){
    printf("%d", a);
}

int main(){
    int a=3;
    return 0;
}
```

Will this code work?  
The answer is: No.

Because the variable a is a local variable of the function main, but where printf executed is not in main.

Then how to make a variable which can be accessed from both main and temp?

Here comes the global function.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
int a=3;

void temp(){
    printf("%d", a);
}

int main(){
    printf("%d", a);
    return 0;
}
```

## Recursive function

A function that calls itself until the conditions that I want is correct is called recursive function.

It's better to understand which the codes, so I'll give you the code which prints the fibonacci numbers.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int factorial(int n)
{
    if (!n)
        return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}

int main(void)
{
    printf("%d", factorial(3));
    return 0;
}
```
