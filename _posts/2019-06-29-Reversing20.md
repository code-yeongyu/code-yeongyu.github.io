Damn, today's post is not about computer science again.  
To be honest, I agree that I'm too busy these days. I didn't have much time to study computer science.

BTW, I want to talk about the thoughts that I have these days.  
It's true that I didn't study much about reverse engineering.

One thing is about the actual hacking and the hackings in CTF.  
It seems the actual hacking and the hackings in CTF feels quite different.  
As I said before, I want to analyze products such as game consoles.

Others say that hackings in CTF are about finding the serial, therefore I have to analyze the algorithm which makes that serial.  
But in real hacking, I have to find out the whole structure of the program. So it feels like they're very different.

One other thing is about the money. I used to study web programming. If I kept studying web programming, I can earn a little amount of money as a freelancer. You know, it's really hard to earn money as a freelancer if I am not skillful enough.

So I'm thinking and thinking about it, but I'll be the greatest reverser/hacker in the world. You know, there's an old saying, fake it till you make it.
