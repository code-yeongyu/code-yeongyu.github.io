Today was the most exciting moment while studying reverse engineering.  
With the commenting features, breakpoint features, and other stuff in ollydbg, I patched the message "Hello World!!" into the "Hello Reversing".

So, there were to ways to modify the string.


The first one is just to edit the value in the memory, and it's only available when the text that you wanna change to is not bigger than the original string area.


The last one is was to create the string in another area in the memory, which is not used, called the 'null padding'.  
I set the string "Hello Reversing" at the memory value at 409F50, which is the null padding.

Also, I actually saw how memory sections work. With the book I study with, I was able to see the text, data, code sections.  
and I was able to see them clearly by the memory addresses.

So the hello world.exe's data section was the 409XXX, and the code section was the 401XXX.

Anyway, studying reverse engineering is very exciting. Therefore I...
