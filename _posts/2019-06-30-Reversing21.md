I used the search for > all referenced strings feature to find the position of the handler function of the check button.  
![prologue](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock.github.io/master/assets/pictures/crackme_prologue.png)  
What I did is to find the positions of string and try to find where the function prologue is.  
![find_strings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock.github.io/master/assets/pictures/find_strings.png)  
Anyway, while reading the codes in that function, I found a je which looked like a part where decides the result of the serial.  
So I set the breakpoint of that, and I found the serial code for what I typed at the stack.  
![serial_in_stack](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock.github.io/master/assets/pictures/serial_in_stack.png)  
I was able to solve in this way.  
![crackme2_success](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock.github.io/master/assets/pictures/crackme2_success.png)  
But I want to analyze the algorithm, so I'll post about it tomorrow.
