It's the hint of level 20. And there's a printf which looks pretty weird.  
YES. THIS is the problem which requires me to use the format string bug(FSB).

printf is the shortage of 'print format', and this function has a feature prints a string with format from a given address from parameter until '\0' which means null.  
But there's a problem when calling printf with a variable.  
The hacker can freely put the format.

# So what?

Let me say I use the format in printf.  
In order to print the format, the function will get the value from the given parameters.

As I wrote before, at the calling convention, C uses \_stdcall to give parameters.  
This means that when a function is called, the data at the top of the stack is what printf consider as arguments. (This is the reason why weird value appears if you use the format in printf without giving parameters)

Anyway, we have to know a format %n to attack with FSB.  
%n is a format which saves how many bytes are used before using %n to the given address.

The 41414141 appears when I called %x for four times.  
This means that the array 'bleh' is actually located where I try pop for three times.

# Let's just attack

Usually, attacks using FSB attacks the .dtors segment.

GCC compiler creates two segments which called before calling main and called after executing main. They are .ctors(constructor) and the .dtors(destructor).

You know, after the SFP(the EBP before calling a function), there's a RET which the address of .dtors located.

Anyway, since I'm not able to modify the value of RET, I have to change the content of .dtors.  
With the objdump, let's figure out the address of .dtors which we are gonna edit.  
![level20_objdump](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-riZz8KsREto/XSdnh2-rfjI/AAAAAAAAUTE/6D8mF6Dwu6kjr_xNSVv3sf6-m7gPxxm8ACLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2019-07-12%2Bat%2B01.44.35.png)

8049594.  It's the address of .dtors. However, if the value of this is not 0, it executes the dtors+4!  
          So I have to attack it with shellcode(eggshell).

But the address is too big to overwrite the memory. So I have to divide it half and half.

I early mentioned that %n changes the value of the given address. Therefore the payload should be like this:  
(Any value)*4+([.dtors+4])+(Any value)*4+([.dtors+8])+(%8x)\*3+"%[address of shellcode 1 - the total bytes of printed before]c%n"+"%[address of shellcode 2 - the total bytes of printed before]c%n"

To explain each of them,  
The (Any value)\*4: To handle "%[address of shellcode 1]c" (cuz when use format, the stack pops)
The ([.dtors+4]), ([.dtors+8]): To set where %n to edit.  
And because %n saves how much bytes are used into the given address. It's the reason why I subtracted the total bytes of printed before when calling %c.
h
So I made a payload like this.

```bash
(python -c 'print "AAAA\x98\x95\x04\x08AAAA\x9a\x95\x04\x08"+"%8x%8x%8x"+"%[address 1]c%n"+"%[address 2]c%n"'; cat)|./attackmeâ€‹
```

So I get an address with some C codes.
