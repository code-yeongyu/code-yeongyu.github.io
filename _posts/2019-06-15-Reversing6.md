I haven't studied a lot today.  
I learned about the features of ollydbg, especially the basecamp.  
So, there are mainly 4 ways to make base camp.  
The first one is to remember the address of the basecamp, use the goto feature, and type the F4 to run execute until cursor.  
The second one is to use the breakpoint feature.  
You can make breakpoints by typing the F2 Key. By typing F9, you'll see your ollydbg stops at the breakpoint.  
The next thing is to make comments with the key ';', and check it at the user-defined comments window.  
And another thing is to use the label feature, which replaces all that specific address into that comment.
