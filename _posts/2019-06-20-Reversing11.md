When I started to learn C, all of the tutorials are saying "You should define variables at the top of the function".  
I wrote about the stack section which saves the local variables yesterday.  
At my school club, I had the opportunity to analyze a c program, while solving a pwnable problem.  
I found something at the assembly code. The compiler calculates the total size of all the local variables in a function, and they allocate it in a word(in an operation).  
Because Modern C compilers are smart enough, nowadays we can define the variables anywhere in the function. Like in a loop, middle of the function, or bottom of the function.

So I wanted to see what happens in assembly if I define variables, not at the top of the function.

Therefore, I made four codes which the position of where the variable defines are different.  
BTW, This is pretty far from the subject of today's post, but I found another thing that if a variable defined and not being used, it's not even allocated by the compiler.


Anyway, the codes look like this.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    char sentence[1024] = "nothing";
    char array[512] = "nothing";
    int i;
    printf("%s %s", sentence, array);
    return 0;
}
```
This code is a recommended way to make variables. The useless variable 'i' is defined for compare with the loop.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    char sentence[1024] = "nothing";
    int i;
    for(i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        char array[512] = "nothing";
        printf("%s %s", sentence, array);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
and in this code, I put a variable(technically array) in a loop.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    char sentence[1024] = "nothing";
    int i;
    printf("%s", sentence);
    for(i = 0; i < 10;i++);
    char array[512] = "nothing";
    printf("%s", array);
    return 0;
}
```
Also, I defined the array the bottom of the code.

Yeah, as I expected, the compiler which I tried with (Apple LLVM) was smart enough to improve my dirty code. As you can see in the assembly code, the operation "sub 0x640" was the same in the top one and the bottom one.
But one thing I thought weird was the "sub 0x630", which was in the loop code. Somehow, the size has been changed.

What I wanted to figure out by today's experiment was 'What happens if you make a variable in a loop, or bottom of the function?'.  
And it seems like I've got an answer. The answer was "the compiler makes and allocates it just as you define the variable at the top of the function".

Anyway, it was my first time to try 64-bit assembly debugging. Therefore I'm a bit embarrassed about longer memory addresses, different names of registers(such as ESP to RSP). But because it's also a computer that's based on x86, the assembly codes were not that different.

It was very interesting! Understanding a code which I wrote in a computer's perspective was very interesting. Not only for reverse engineering, but also for the programming, I think it's really good to learn the assembly.

Happy Reversing :)
