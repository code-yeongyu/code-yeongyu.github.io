```c
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{

  int var;
  int check = 0x04030201;
  char buf[40];

  fgets(buf,45,stdin);

  printf("\n[buf]: %s\n", buf);
  printf("[check] %p\n", check);

  if ((check != 0x04030201) && (check != 0xdeadbeef))
    printf ("\nYou are on the right way!\n");

  if (check == 0xdeadbeef)
   {
     printf("Yeah dude! You win!\nOpening your shell...\n");
     setreuid(geteuid(), geteuid());
     system("/bin/bash");
     printf("Shell closed! Bye.\n");
   }
   return 0;
}
```

It's the source code of it.  
And in the stack, it will be located like:

[buf][check]  
[var]

And in the fgets function, it receives the user's input as the size of 45 bytes, while the size of buf is 40.

So the payload is super easy, just to fill all the buf and put the deadbeef after it!
