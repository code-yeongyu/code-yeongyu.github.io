Hello, it's my first post for this blogs.  
I'm basically a high school student in South Korea. Therefore the book I'm gonna use for studying is a Korean book called "리버싱 핵심원리", which means "principles for the points in reversing".  
I'm planning to write what I studied for each day.  

# Let's Start !

Reverse Engineering is a series of courses about analyzing softwares, products, etc.  
By analyzing them, you can understand how the things work, improve the products, and you can add your ideas on it.  

So, there are two ways for analyze something.

* Static Analysis
* Dynamic Analysis

Static Analysis is a way by observing the appearance of the file.  
In this method, you don't have to execute the file.  
This method is to check the kind of the file, size, header, APIs, internal strings, debugging informations, etc...
You can do this by using the disassembler.  

Dynamic Analysis is a way to analyze a file by executing the file.  
By debugging, you need to observe how the codes flow, and the state of the memory.  
In this method, you can analyze by observing the file, registry, and the networks.  
Also, you can use the debugger.

I know the post is very little, but I'll weigh more for '1 day, 1 posts'.
