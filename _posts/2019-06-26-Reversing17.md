About the EAX  
- Mentioned before that this register is used for calculating and returning values when a function is ended.  
- While analyzing an example file of the stack frame, I found that when a calculation is done, and when the value needs to be returned, because EAX register is used to calculating values, the function is straightly done without doing anything because there's already a returning value in the EAX.
- So, this is the code I was talking about. As you can see, just right after the adding calculation is done, the function ends.
- ![assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock/kim-yeon-gyu-exlock.github.io/master/assets/pictures/retn.png)

When after the function is ended, because the parameters (which are stacked) are unneeded anymore, there is a code that adds 8 into esp to remove that space in the memory.

This is one of the 'calling convention', and this way, like cleaning the parameters from the function which called another function, is called 'cdecl'.  
And the way that function who have called by a caller is called 'stdcall'.  
So, briefly, caller cleans the stack: it's cdecl.  
Calee cleans the stack: it's stdcall.

When you want to make EAX as 0, XOR EAX, EAX is faster than mov EAX, 0.  
So, it's commonly used for the c code such as this.
```c
return 0;
```
