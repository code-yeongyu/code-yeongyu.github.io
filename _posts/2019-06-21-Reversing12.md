# What is 'CrackMe'?
CrackMe is a program that is coded for people who want to practice reverse engineering to crack, as its name.  
The book I studied with mentions that this book is actually helpful for being friendly with the assembly codes.  
So from tomorrow, I'll start cracking it.  (Cuz I don't have much time for today. I just got home, and it was 23:30!)
